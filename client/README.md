## Dependencies
Install `node` and `yarn`, then `yarn init` will take care of the rest.

## How to Run

Build the project files to `out/`:
> yarn run build

Start a development server:
> yarn run dev

This will build the project to `out/` as you edit the source, but won't automatically refresh the browser page.
